description: "A scene set perfectly: the haute monde on the magnificent
  hamartia, a cruise ship with an endless buffet line and a stunning promenade.
  The scene shatters: calamity crops up when the vessel suffers an engine
  failure and all but one lifeboat remains undamaged. Now, itâ€™s everyone for
  themselves and true colours start to show. Can you persuade your way to
  survival or will your voice sink to the depths, soundless?"
