  Chaos has ensued and the world now needs your aid!! A deadly pathogen has
  caused an outbreak of a life- threatening disease and you must uncover the
  truth. 


  Unleash your untapped powers of deduction and traverse a labyrinth of secrets, following elusive trails that lead to a shattering revelation. Brace yourself for an electrifying pursuit, employing blood testing, dna decryption, gel electrophoresis, and more. With time slipping away, only the sharpest minds can out maneuver the rest, saving themselves and the rest of humanity. 


  The burning question echoes: will you surrender to the thrill and do whatever it takes to unveil the imposter?
