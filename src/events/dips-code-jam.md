  #### Rules


  1. Contestants will be required to solve questions and provide code that can be verified.

  2. The time limit for solving the questions is 3 hours. At the end of the 3rd hour, the winners will be adjudicated on the basis of the number of completed questions and completeness/efficiency of the given solutions.

  3. The completeness of the code will be determined by the number of test cases each solution can pass.

  4. If two contestants were to score equal points, time will be used to determine as tiebreaker.

  5. This is an **individual** event. No teams allowed.


  #### Scoring


  1. Each challenge has a pre-determined score.

  2. A participant’s score depends on the number of test cases their code submission successfully
     passes.
  3. If a participant submits more than one solution per challenge, then the participant’s score will reflect
     the highest score achieved.
  4. Participants are ranked by score. If two or more participants achieve the same score, then the tie is
     broken by the total time taken to submit the last solution.
