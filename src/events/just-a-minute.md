description: Vigilant and perceptive senses along with an agile reaction time
  are vital if you plan to succeed. Be wary of your own missteps and fasten your
  harness, for a single stumble could cost you dearly. Hold onto your
  competitors' words like your life depends on it and call them out on their
  slip-ups to gain a chance to prove your worth. Will you soar to the summits,
  or dejectedly make your way down? Only time will tell, and all you have is
  just a minute.
rules: Adherence to time limits will be strictly administered.
