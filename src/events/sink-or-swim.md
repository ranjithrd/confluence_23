description: A voyage into the unknown necessitates the possession of valor,
  grit and utmost prudence. Traverse through twisting timbers and across the
  raging seas to find within yourself ingenuity ready to be unleashed. Come out
  the other end with an unparalleled sense of valiance and a story that compares
  to no other. Does your ragtag team of adventurers bear the gumption and genius
  required to brandish your swords and unveil it to the cosmos, or will you fall
  through, broken and battered?
